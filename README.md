Marvel Wiki App
Utilizes data from https://developer.marvel.com/ using axios.

Welcome to the Marvel Wiki App! This project is inspired by my love for Marvel Comics growing up. I created this app to provide fans with a comprehensive resource for exploring Marvel characters and their appearances in various comics, stories, and events. The app allows users to search for characters, view detailed information, create accounts, and manage a list of favorite characters.

Features
Character Search: Users can search for Marvel characters and view detailed information, including their appearances in comics, stories, and events.
User Accounts: Users can create accounts to manage and save a list of their favorite characters.
Data Integration: The app utilizes the Marvel API to fetch and display data.
Technologies Used
Backend
Express/Node.js: Used for handling server-side logic and API requests.
MongoDB: Used for storing user data and character lists.
Frontend
React.js: Used for building the user interface.
CSS, HTML, Tailwind, Bootstrap: Used for styling and layout.
Challenges
One of the main challenges faced during the development of this project was gaining overall comfort with MongoDB. This was my first independent project implementing MongoDB, and getting the CRUD basics down was an obstacle I proudly overcame. Prior to this project, my backend knowledge was primarily with Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL. Essentially, all of the backend features in this project were relatively new to me.

I addedd the ability for users to add/remove comic books to their cart. Furthermore, they can place an order for their carted items. 

Future Plans
Ability to view and cancel orders.
Like/Unlike Button: I plan to add a like/unlike button to enhance user interaction with characters.
